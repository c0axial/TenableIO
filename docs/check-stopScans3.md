> check-stopScans3.py

**Stop long scans:**
This script is good to run as a task.  If scans can't run into business hours and you don't want to get up and look to see if they are running - add this as a cron job and it will check for you, stop as needed and log that it did it. 


*usage* `python3 check-stopScans3.py --scan "Scan Name" (encompass spaces in search in quotes)`
