# TenableIO
Tenable.io has a lot of things that can be done with the API.  https://cloud.tenable.com/api#/overview  

It also has a lot of things that can only be done in the API.  Here's my contribution to what I have been able to do with it that helps us out. 

Use at will.  Make better at will.  There are variables that need to be set in each file.  Make sure to check that out, otherwise errors abound!

Files using python 2.6 are noted as ending in 2.6.  All others tested in 3.5+.

## Scripts and what they do are noted in respective readme files in the docs/ directory.
